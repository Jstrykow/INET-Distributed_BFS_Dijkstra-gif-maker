Project visualize Distributed BFS with Dijkstra favor algorithm. I had a problem understanding this algorithm during the lecture, so I studied and coded it. I had an idea to present graphs from the presentation as gifs. The project uses the Networkx library to create pyplot graph images,
then with imageio, convert images to gif.

In globals.py user can change the seed if the resulting gif is unclear.

In the img/ directory are stored .png files of each step.

In main.py user can add or odd nodes and edges but must set the root node.

Example result gif:
